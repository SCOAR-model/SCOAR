SCOAR WRF-ROMS-WW3 coupled Modeling System The SCOAR regional coupled modeling system couples WRF, ROMS, and WW3 via COARE3.5 bulk flux algorithm implemented in WRF surface-layer module. 

The coupler is nothing fancy but is a flexible and efficient input-output file coupler. The SCOAR has been used to study the physics and impacts of air-sea-wave interactions in various regions; for the publication based on SCOAR: please see https://hseo.whoi.edu/publications/.

The model was originally developed by Hyodae Seo (hseo@whoi.edu) by coupling WRF (and RSM)and ROMS. Dr. Cesar Sauvage has introduced wave coupling to SCOAR.
