The SCOAR regional coupled modeling system couples WRF, ROMS, and WW3 via COARE3.5 bulk flux algorithm implemented in WRF surface-layer modules. WRF, ROMS, and WW3 are publically available models.

  ROMS: https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms
  WW3: https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3
  The SCOAR coupler is a flexible and efficient input-output file coupler, with 2-D online smoothing for eddy filtering. The code is available through this repository.

The SCOAR has been used to study the physics and impacts of air-sea-wave interactions in various regions; for the publication, please see https://hseo.whoi.edu/publications/.

The SCOAR system was originally developed by Hyodae Seo (hseo@whoi.edu) by coupling WRF (and RSM)and ROMS. Dr. Cesar Sauvage has introduced wave coupling, through the project funded by the NOAA CVP program for ATOMIC.
